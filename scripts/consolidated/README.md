- `update-control-file.sh` - Control file updates (legacy)
- `migrate-to-monorepo.sh` - Migration utilities (legacy)

## Usage

### Quick Operations
```bash
# Start Phoenix system
./scripts/consolidated/core/run-phoenix.sh

# Initialize environment
./scripts/consolidated/core/initialize-environment.sh

# Run full verification
./scripts/consolidated/testing/full-verification.sh

# Deploy system
./scripts/consolidated/deployment/deploy.sh
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/consolidated/testing/full-verification.sh

# Test specific components
./scripts/consolidated/testing/verify-services.sh
./scripts/consolidated/testing/verify-apis.sh
./scripts/consolidated/testing/verify-configs.sh
```

### Maintenance
```bash
# System cleanup
./scripts/consolidated/maintenance/cleanup.sh

# Backup data
./scripts/consolidated/maintenance/backup_phoenix_data.sh

# Health checks
./scripts/consolidated/monitoring/health_check_aggregator.sh
```

## Script Categories

| Category | Count | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Core | 2 | Essential system operations |
| Deployment | 3 | System deployment and configuration |
| Testing | 7 | Testing and validation |
| Monitoring | 2 | System monitoring and health |
| Maintenance | 3 | System maintenance and data management |
| Utils | 4 | General utilities and integrations |
| Legacy | 3 | Older scripts and migration tools |

## Making Scripts Executable

All scripts are made executable during the consolidation process. If you need to make them executable manually:

```bash
# Make all scripts executable
find scripts/consolidated -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;

# Make specific category executable
chmod +x scripts/consolidated/testing/*.sh
```

## Script Dependencies

Most scripts assume:
- Docker and docker-compose are installed
- Working directory is the Phoenix project root
- Environment is properly initialized (via initialize-environment.sh)

## Maintenance Notes

- All scripts maintain backward compatibility with existing references
- Original locations are preserved with symbolic links
- Script consolidation improves discoverability and maintainability
- Regular updates should check both new location and original references
