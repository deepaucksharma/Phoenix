### Emergency Contacts
- **On-Call**: Check PagerDuty schedule
- **Slack**: #phoenix-incidents
- **Escalation**: Platform team lead

## Common Commands

### Health Checks
```bash
# Quick system health check
docker-compose ps
docker stats --no-stream
curl http://localhost:9090/-/healthy
curl http://localhost:13133
```

### Force Optimization Mode
```bash
# Emergency aggressive mode
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/mode \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mode": "aggressive"}'
```

### Scale Up Collectors
```bash
# Emergency resource increase
export OTELCOL_MAIN_MEMORY_LIMIT_MIB=2048
export OTELCOL_MAIN_GOMAXPROCS=4
docker-compose up -d otelcol-main
```

## Runbook Standards

### Structure
Each runbook should contain:
1. **Alert Name** - Prometheus alert that triggers this runbook
2. **Description** - What the issue is
3. **Severity** - Critical/Warning/Info
4. **Impact** - Business/technical impact
5. **Detection** - How to verify the issue
6. **Immediate Actions** - Steps to mitigate
7. **Root Cause Analysis** - How to investigate
8. **Long-term Fixes** - Permanent solutions
9. **Prevention** - How to avoid recurrence
10. **Communication** - Who to notify

### Updates
- Review quarterly
- Update after incidents
- Test procedures in staging
- Version control all changes

## Training Resources

### New On-Call Engineers
1. Read [Metric Standards](operational-procedures/metric-standards.md)
2. Review [Common Issues](troubleshooting/common-issues.md)
3. Practice emergency procedures in staging
4. Shadow experienced on-call engineer

### Drills
- Monthly cardinality explosion drill
- Quarterly disaster recovery test
- Annual full system failure simulation

## Contributing

### Adding New Runbooks
1. Use the template below
2. Test all commands
3. Get review from senior engineer
4. Update this index

- Training gaps
- System improvements needed

### Effectiveness Metrics
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)
- Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)
- Runbook completion rate
- False positive rate
