# PR Fixes Summary

This document outlines the fixes made to resolve the failing PR checks in the SA-OMF project.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Go Version Mismatch
- Fixed the Go version in go.mod to match the CI workflow (1.21.0)
- Removed the toolchain directive which was causing compatibility issues

### 2. Component Registration
- Added the missing adaptive_topk processor to the list of imported components in main.go
- Registered the adaptive_topk factory in the processor factory list

### 3. Package Naming Standardization
- Standardized package references in code to use underscores (adaptive_pid, adaptive_topk)
- Updated import references in test/integration/control_loop_test.go
- Ensured consistent usage of Config types (from adaptivepid.Config to adaptive_pid.Config)

### 4. Docker Path Correction
- Fixed the Docker file path in CI workflow by removing the leading ./ from deploy/docker/Dockerfile

## Next Steps

1. Run the CI workflow again to verify that all checks now pass
2. If any issues remain, address them with further fixes
3. Consider adding a pre-commit hook to ensure consistent naming conventions across the codebase

## Additional Recommendations

1. Update the module name in go.mod from github.com/yourorg/sa-omf to the actual organization name
2. Add more comprehensive testing for the adaptive_topk processor
3. Standardize file and directory naming conventions (with_underscores or withoutunderscores)
4. Consider using Go modules with semantic versioning for better dependency management
