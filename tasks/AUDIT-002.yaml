description: |
  The Config Patch Validator component is responsible for validating configuration
  patches before they are applied to processors. This is a security-critical component
  that must ensure configuration changes are safe and valid. This audit task requires
  a comprehensive review of the component.
  
  The audit should include:
  
  1. Code Quality Assessment
     - Review validation logic and thoroughness
     - Verify proper schema enforcement
     - Assess error handling and reporting
     - Check for validation bypasses
     - Verify thread safety
  
  2. Security Review
     - Identify potential security vulnerabilities
     - Check for validation loopholes
     - Verify defense against malicious inputs
     - Assess error message information leakage
     - Evaluate logging of validation failures
  
  3. Performance Assessment
     - Evaluate validation efficiency
     - Assess complex validation rules performance
     - Check for potential bottlenecks
  
  4. Interface Compliance
     - Verify component implements required interfaces
     - Check validation contract compliance
     - Assess error return consistency
     - Verify thread safety and concurrency
  
  5. Test Evaluation
     - Assess test coverage of validation rules
     - Check for negative test cases
     - Verify edge case handling
     - Evaluate security boundary tests
  
  6. Documentation Review
     - Evaluate validation rule documentation
     - Check for schema documentation
     - Verify API documentation
     - Assess error message documentation
  
  The audit should follow the process defined in /audit/AUDIT_AGENDA.md and result in:
  1. A detailed audit report at /audit/components/control/configpatch_validator.md
  2. Tasks created for each identified issue
  3. Updates to the audit summary and dashboard
  
  This audit is a high priority as the Config Patch Validator is a critical security
  component that protects the system from invalid or malicious configuration changes.
