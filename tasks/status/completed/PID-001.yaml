title: "Implement PID Controller for Adaptive Processing"
description: |
  Implement a production-ready PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller for automatic adaptation
  of processing parameters based on observed metrics. The controller will be a core component of the
  self-regulation system, allowing processors to dynamically adjust their behavior to maintain
  target KPI values without manual intervention.

implementation_details: |
  Implemented a comprehensive PID controller with the following features:
  - Proportional, Integral, and Derivative term calculations
  - Anti-windup protection with back-calculation
  - Oscillation detection with circuit breaker functionality
  - Low-pass filtering for derivative term to reduce noise sensitivity
  - Thread-safety with mutex locking
  - Configurable limits for all parameters
  - Comprehensive metrics collection
  - Integration with the adaptive_pid processor
  
  The implementation is located in internal/control/pid/controller.go and includes
  an oscillation detector in internal/control/pid/circuitbreaker.go.
  
  All acceptance criteria have been met, and the controller has been integrated
  with the adaptive_pid processor for dynamic parameter adjustment.
