description: |
  The current PID controller implementation needs an anti-windup mechanism
  to prevent integral term from growing too large when the output is saturated.
  
  This should:
  1. Add a configurable integrator limit parameter
  2. Implement clamping of the integral term
  3. Add reset method to clear the integral term
  4. Update documentation
