description: |
  The Adaptive TopK processor is a key component for metrics cardinality control,
  but currently has no dedicated tests. This lack of tests means potential bugs
  or regressions could go undetected.
  
  This task requires implementing comprehensive tests for the Adaptive TopK processor,
  including:
  
  1. Unit tests for core functionality
     - Configuration validation
     - TopK item tracking
     - Metric filtering
     - Coverage calculation
     - Dynamic k-value adaptation
  
  2. Interface compliance tests
     - UpdateableProcessor implementation
     - ConfigPatch handling
     - Status reporting
  
  3. Performance tests
     - Resource usage with varying input sizes
     - Scaling with different k values
     - Behavior with skewed distributions
  
  4. Integration tests
     - Interaction with other processors in pipeline
     - End-to-end metric flow
  
  Tests should be implemented in a new directory test/processors/adaptive_topk/
  and should follow the testing patterns used in other processor tests. The tests
  should use the testutils and metrics_generator packages to create test data.
  
  Example test file structure:
  - test/processors/adaptive_topk/config_test.go (for configuration tests)
  - test/processors/adaptive_topk/processor_test.go (for core functionality)
  - test/processors/adaptive_topk/interface_test.go (for interface compliance)
  - test/processors/adaptive_topk/performance_test.go (for performance tests)
