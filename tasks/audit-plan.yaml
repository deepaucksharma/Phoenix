description: |
  The initial audit covered only 4 out of 20 components (20% coverage).
  This task requires creating a comprehensive schedule to audit the
  remaining components in a prioritized manner.
  
  The audit schedule should:
  
  1. Cover all remaining components:
     - Remaining processors (8)
     - Remaining control components (2)
     - Remaining utility algorithms (5)
     - Any new components added since the initial audit
  
  2. Prioritize components based on:
     - Security criticality
     - Operational importance
     - Complexity
     - Integration points
     - Recent changes
  
  3. Assign resources:
     - Identify auditors for each component
     - Estimate effort required
     - Align with team availability
  
  4. Establish realistic timeline:
     - Set target dates for each component
     - Align with project milestones
     - Consider dependencies between components
     - Build in buffer for unexpected issues
  
  5. Define review process:
     - Schedule regular reviews of audit progress
     - Define escalation process for critical findings
     - Establish process for updating the schedule
  
  The output of this task should be a detailed schedule document that
  includes:
  - Component list with priorities
  - Assigned auditors
  - Target dates
  - Estimated effort
  - Dependencies
  - Review milestones
  
  This schedule will be used to track progress and ensure that all
  components are audited in a timely manner. It should be reviewed
  and updated regularly as the project evolves.
