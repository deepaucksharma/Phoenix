  - "Test introduces YAML syntax error into policy.yaml while pic_control is watching for changes"
  - "pic_control detects the error and logs a clear message about parsing failure"

  - "policy_reload_failed_total metric increments"
  - "System logs include details about the syntax error location"
  - "When error is fixed, system successfully reloads the policy"
description: |
  When policy files are edited manually or through automation, syntax errors
  may be introduced. This test verifies that the pic_control extension gracefully
  handles such errors and continues operating with the last known good policy.
  
  The test should:
  
  1. Start the collector with a valid policy.yaml
  2. Verify initial policy is loaded correctly
  3. Introduce syntax errors into policy.yaml:
     - YAML indentation error
     - Missing closing bracket
     - Invalid type (number where string expected)
     - Duplicate key
  4. Verify error handling:
     - pic_control detects the syntax error during reload
     - Clear error message is logged with error location
     - policy_reload_failed_total metric increments
     - System continues running with last known good policy
  5. Fix the error and verify recovery:
     - System successfully reloads the corrected policy
     - New policy settings take effect
     - policy_reload_success_total metric increments
  
  This test is important for ensuring operational resilience when policy
  files are modified, which is a common occurrence in production environments.
  
  Implementation should include various types of syntax errors to verify
  robust parsing and validation. The test should also verify that partial
  policy updates don't corrupt the internal policy state.
