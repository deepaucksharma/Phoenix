# Phoenix Project Review Plan

This directory contains review plans and templates for the Phoenix project. The reviews are organized to systematically assess the quality, security, and performance of key components.

## Review Documents

### Guidelines and Templates
- [Review Guidelines](REVIEW-GUIDELINES.md) - Comprehensive guidelines for different types of components
- [Review Template](REVIEW-TEMPLATE.md) - Standard template for component reviews

### Component Review Plans
- [PID Controller Review](PID-CONTROLLER-REVIEW.md) - Review plan for the PID controller
- [UpdateableProcessor Interface Review](UPDATEABLE-PROCESSOR-REVIEW.md) - Review plan for the core interface
- [PIC Control Extension Review](PIC-CONTROL-EXTENSION-REVIEW.md) - Review plan for the PIC control extension

## Review Process

1. **Preparation**:
   - Assign review tasks to appropriate reviewers
   - Schedule review meetings
   - Set up testing environments

2. **Individual Reviews**:
   - Follow the component-specific review plan
   - Document findings using the template
   - Create tasks for identified improvements

3. **Review Meetings**:
   - Present findings to the team
   - Prioritize improvements
   - Assign implementation tasks

4. **Implementation**:
   - Create PRs for approved improvements
   - Update documentation
   - Update tests

5. **Verification**:
   - Verify that improvements have been implemented correctly
   - Update review documents with current status
   - Document lessons learned

## Priority Order

Reviews should be conducted in the following order based on component criticality:

1. **High Priority**:
   - UpdateableProcessor Interface
   - PID Controller
   - PIC Control Extension
   - Safety Monitor

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Adaptive PID Processor
   - Adaptive TopK Processor
   - Priority Tagger Processor
   - Configuration Schema

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Utility packages
   - Test helpers
   - Documentation

## Scheduling

| Component | Estimated Review Time | Recommended Reviewer |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| UpdateableProcessor Interface | 4 hours | Architect |
| PID Controller | 6 hours | Performance Engineer |
| PIC Control Extension | 8 hours | Security Auditor |
| Adaptive PID Processor | 6 hours | Implementer |
| Adaptive TopK Processor | 6 hours | Implementer |
| Priority Tagger | 4 hours | Implementer |
| Configuration Schema | 4 hours | Architect |
| Safety Monitor | 6 hours | Security Auditor |

## Review Metrics

The following metrics will be tracked:
- Number of issues found by severity
- Issue resolution time
- Test coverage improvement
- Performance improvement
- Documentation improvement

Regular reports will be generated to track progress and ensure that all critical issues are addressed.
