# Component Review: PIC Control Extension

## Component Information
- **Component Type**: Extension
- **Location**: `/internal/extension/pic_control_ext/extension.go`
- **Primary Purpose**: Central governance layer for configuration changes

## Review Plan

### 1. Security Assessment
- [ ] Verify policy file permission checking
- [ ] Check authentication for configuration changes
- [ ] Assess rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Verify input validation for ConfigPatch objects
- [ ] Review safe mode activation mechanism
- [ ] Check for security logging and audit trail

### 2. Processor Registration Management
- [ ] Evaluate processor discovery mechanism
- [ ] Verify proper registration of UpdateableProcessor instances
- [ ] Check for race conditions in processor map access
- [ ] Assess handling of processor startup/shutdown
- [ ] Review unregistration process

### 3. Configuration Patch Handling
- [ ] Verify validation before applying patches
- [ ] Check for parameter boundary enforcement
- [ ] Assess patch routing to target processors
- [ ] Review error handling for failed patches
- [ ] Verify patch history management
- [ ] Check implementation of TTL enforcement

### 4. Thread Safety Assessment
- [ ] Review mutex usage for critical sections
- [ ] Check for potential deadlocks
- [ ] Verify consistent lock/unlock patterns
- [ ] Assess concurrent access to shared resources
- [ ] Review thread safety in callbacks

### 5. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Evaluate lock contention potential
- [ ] Check memory allocation patterns
- [ ] Assess scaling with many processors
- [ ] Identify potential bottlenecks
- [ ] Review resource usage under high patch rates

### 6. Error Handling
- [ ] Verify error propagation
- [ ] Check recovery from validation failures
- [ ] Assess handling of processor errors
- [ ] Review logging of errors
- [ ] Verify extension stability after errors

### 7. Testing Assessment
- [ ] Check test coverage for validation logic
- [ ] Verify tests for concurrency
- [ ] Assess security boundary tests
- [ ] Review integration testing
- [ ] Check performance tests

## Expected Improvements
- Implement comprehensive permission checking for policy files
- Add configurable rate limiting with adaptive thresholds
- Enhance patch validation with schema-based checks
- Implement better processor discovery
- Add metrics collection for monitoring
- Create comprehensive logging and audit trail
