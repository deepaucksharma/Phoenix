description: |
  The Safety Monitor is a critical component responsible for monitoring system resources
  and activating safe mode when thresholds are exceeded. This audit task requires a
  comprehensive review of the component to ensure it functions correctly, securely,
  and efficiently.
  
  The audit should include:
  
  1. Code Quality Assessment
     - Review code structure and organization
     - Evaluate algorithm implementation
     - Assess error handling and edge cases
     - Check for proper resource management
     - Verify thread safety
  
  2. Security Review
     - Identify potential security vulnerabilities
     - Check for proper access control
     - Verify input validation
     - Assess sensitive data handling
     - Evaluate logging practices
  
  3. Performance Assessment
     - Evaluate computational efficiency
     - Assess memory usage
     - Check for potential bottlenecks
     - Verify scaling behavior
  
  4. Interface Compliance
     - Verify component implements required interfaces
     - Check contract compliance
     - Assess error propagation
     - Verify thread safety and concurrency
  
  5. Test Evaluation
     - Assess test coverage and quality
     - Identify missing test scenarios
     - Evaluate performance tests
     - Check for security testing
  
  6. Documentation Review
     - Evaluate inline documentation
     - Check for README and usage examples
     - Verify API documentation
     - Assess operational documentation
  
  The audit should follow the process defined in /audit/AUDIT_AGENDA.md and result in:
  1. A detailed audit report at /audit/components/control/safety_monitor.md
  2. Tasks created for each identified issue
  3. Updates to the audit summary and dashboard
  
  This audit is a high priority as the Safety Monitor is a critical component
  for system stability and protection.
