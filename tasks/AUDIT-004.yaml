description: |
  The Priority Tagger processor tags resources with priority levels based on
  configurable rules, implementing regexp matching for process prioritization.
  This processor is critical for effective resource filtering. This audit task
  requires a comprehensive review of the component.
  
  The audit should include:
  
  1. Code Quality Assessment
     - Review rule matching implementation
     - Evaluate regexp usage and efficiency
     - Assess priority assignment logic
     - Check for proper resource management
     - Verify thread safety and synchronization
  
  2. Security Review
     - Identify potential security vulnerabilities
     - Check for regexp injection vulnerabilities
     - Verify input validation
     - Assess performance DoS vulnerabilities
     - Evaluate logging practices
  
  3. Performance Assessment
     - Evaluate computational efficiency
     - Assess memory usage
     - Check for regexp optimization
     - Verify scaling with number of rules
     - Measure performance with complex regexps
  
  4. Interface Compliance
     - Verify UpdateableProcessor implementation
     - Check metric processing compliance
     - Assess error propagation
     - Verify thread safety and concurrency
  
  5. Test Evaluation
     - Assess test coverage of rule matching
     - Check for regexp edge cases
     - Verify priority assignment testing
     - Evaluate performance tests
  
  6. Documentation Review
     - Evaluate rule configuration documentation
     - Check for regexp guidelines
     - Verify API documentation
     - Assess operational documentation
  
  The audit should follow the process defined in /audit/AUDIT_AGENDA.md and result in:
  1. A detailed audit report at /audit/components/processors/priority_tagger.md
  2. Tasks created for each identified issue
  3. Updates to the audit summary and dashboard
  
  This audit is important as the Priority Tagger processor determines which
  resources receive priority treatment throughout the processing pipeline.
