title: "Implement PID Controller for Adaptive Processing"
description: |
  Implement a production-ready PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller for automatic adaptation
  of processing parameters based on observed metrics. The controller will be a core component of the
  self-regulation system, allowing processors to dynamically adjust their behavior to maintain
  target KPI values without manual intervention.
