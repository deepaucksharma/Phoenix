description: |
  The Adaptive PID processor is a key component that generates configuration patches
  using PID control loops. It monitors KPIs and calculates the configuration changes
  needed to meet targets. This audit task requires a comprehensive review of the component.
  
  The audit should include:
  
  1. Code Quality Assessment
     - Review PID controller integration
     - Evaluate KPI monitoring implementation
     - Assess configuration patch generation
     - Check for proper resource management
     - Verify thread safety and synchronization
  
  2. Security Review
     - Identify potential security vulnerabilities
     - Check for patch generation limits
     - Verify input validation
     - Assess logging practices
     - Evaluate failure modes
  
  3. Performance Assessment
     - Evaluate computational efficiency
     - Assess memory usage
     - Check for potential bottlenecks
     - Verify scaling with number of control loops
  
  4. Interface Compliance
     - Verify UpdateableProcessor implementation
     - Check metric processing compliance
     - Assess error propagation
     - Verify thread safety and concurrency
  
  5. Test Evaluation
     - Assess test coverage of control loops
     - Check for oscillation and stability tests
     - Verify edge case handling
     - Evaluate performance tests
  
  6. Documentation Review
     - Evaluate control loop documentation
     - Check for tuning guidelines
     - Verify API documentation
     - Assess operational documentation
  
  The audit should follow the process defined in /audit/AUDIT_AGENDA.md and result in:
  1. A detailed audit report at /audit/components/processors/adaptive_pid.md
  2. Tasks created for each identified issue
  3. Updates to the audit summary and dashboard
  
  This audit is a high priority as the Adaptive PID processor is central to the
  self-regulating capabilities of the system.
