description: |
  The PIC Control Extension currently lacks dedicated documentation, making it
  difficult for users to understand its configuration options, policy format,
  and behavior. This task requires creating comprehensive documentation for
  the extension.
  
  The documentation should include:
  
  1. A README.md file in the extension directory that explains:
     - The purpose and behavior of the extension
     - How it manages policy files and configuration changes
     - How it interacts with processors
     - Security considerations and best practices
  
  2. Policy documentation:
     - Policy file format specification
     - Schema validation rules
     - Example policy files for common scenarios
     - Best practices for policy management
  
  3. Configuration documentation:
     - All configuration options with explanations
     - Default values and allowed ranges
     - Security implications of different settings
     - Example configurations for common scenarios
  
  4. Operational guide:
     - How to monitor the extension
     - How to troubleshoot common issues
     - How to manage policies in production
     - How to handle safe mode situations
  
  5. Integration guide:
     - How to integrate with processors
     - How to integrate with external systems via OpAMP
     - How to set up testing and development environments
  
  The documentation should be clear, concise, and accessible to users with
  varying levels of familiarity with the system. It should follow the
  documentation patterns used in other parts of the project.
