description: |
  Following the initial component audit, we need a system to continuously
  track audit status, findings, and remediation. This task requires implementing
  a continuous audit tracking system that integrates with our development process.
  
  The implementation should include:
  
  1. Audit tracking infrastructure:
     - Convert the manual audit files to a structured database
     - Create APIs for updating audit status and findings
     - Implement automated scanning to identify new issues
     - Set up scheduled re-audits for critical components
  
  2. Audit dashboard:
     - Real-time visualization of audit status
     - Highlighting of critical and high-priority issues
     - Filtering and searching of findings
     - Trend analysis of issue resolution
  
  3. PR integration:
     - Pre-merge audit checklist for new components
     - Automated verification of audit requirements
     - Issue linking for audit-related fixes
     - Impact assessment for changes to audited components
  
  4. Reporting system:
     - Scheduled audit reports
     - Issue age and resolution tracking
     - Quality metric trending
     - Compliance status
  
  This system should be designed to be lightweight and integrated with
  existing development tools. It should provide clear visibility into
  audit status and help prioritize remediation efforts. The goal is to
  ensure that code quality and security is maintained as the project evolves.
  
  The tracking system should be implemented in phases:
  1. Basic tracking and dashboard
  2. PR integration
  3. Automated scanning
  4. Trending and reporting
