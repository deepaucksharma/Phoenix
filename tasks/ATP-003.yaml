description: |
  The Adaptive TopK processor currently lacks dedicated documentation, making it
  difficult for users to understand its configuration options and behavior. This
  task requires creating comprehensive documentation for the processor.
  
  The documentation should include:
  
  1. A README.md file in the processor directory that explains:
     - The purpose and behavior of the processor
     - How it selects and tracks top-k items
     - How it calculates and maintains coverage
     - How it integrates with the adaptive control system
  
  2. Configuration documentation:
     - All configuration options with explanations
     - Default values and allowed ranges
     - Validation rules
     - Example configurations for common scenarios
  
  3. Metrics documentation:
     - List of metrics emitted by the processor
     - What each metric represents
     - How to interpret the metrics
     - How to use the metrics for monitoring
  
  4. Usage examples:
     - Basic usage with default settings
     - Configuring for high cardinality environments
     - Integrating with other processors
     - Fine-tuning for specific workloads
  
  5. Performance guidance:
     - Memory and CPU usage characteristics
     - Scaling with different k values
     - Recommendations for different environments
     - Potential bottlenecks and how to address them
  
  The documentation should be clear, concise, and accessible to users with
  varying levels of familiarity with the system. It should follow the
  documentation patterns used in other parts of the project.
