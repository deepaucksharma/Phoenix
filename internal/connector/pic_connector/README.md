# pic_connector Exporter

The `pic_connector` exporter forwards configuration patches generated by the
`pid_decider` processor to the `pic_control` extension. Patches are represented
as OTLP metrics with the name `aemf_ctrl_proposed_patch` and converted into
`ConfigPatch` objects during export.

## Configuration

The connector currently has no custom settings. Enable it in the `exporters`
section:

```yaml
exporters:
  pic_connector: {}
```

Add the exporter to the control pipeline so that patches produced by
`pid_decider` reach the `pic_control` extension:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    control:
      receivers: [prometheus/self]
      processors: [pid_decider]
      exporters: [pic_connector]
```

## Example Usage

When the collector receives a metric describing a proposed configuration patch,
the connector looks up the `pic_control` extension and submits the patch through
its API. Validation and safety checks are then handled by `pic_control`.
