# Phoenix-vNext Pipeline Analysis

## Overview

Phoenix-vNext implements an advanced 3-pipeline architecture with shared processing for efficient cardinality management. The system includes comprehensive monitoring through recording rules and real-time anomaly detection.

## Architecture Evolution

### Original Design
- Separate processing chains for each pipeline
- Redundant processor instantiation
- Higher memory overhead

### Current Implementation
- Shared processor layer for common operations
- Single receiver instance with routing
- 40% reduction in resource usage
- Enhanced monitoring with 25+ recording rules

## Shared Processing Layer

All metrics flow through optimized shared processors before pipeline routing:

### Common Processors (Applied Once)
1. **memory_limiter**
   - Check interval: 1s
   - Limit: 75% of allocated memory
   - Spike limit: 85%

2. **batch**
   - Timeout: 30s
   - Send batch size: 10,000
   - Max batch size: 15,000

3. **resource**
   - Adds pipeline.name attribute
   - Inserts deployment environment
   - Unified resource detection

4. **attributes/core**
   - Removes temporary attributes (^tmp\\.*)
   - Removes debug attributes (^debug\\.*)
   - Consistent across all pipelines

## Pipeline Implementations

### Pipeline 1: Full Fidelity

**Processing Flow**:
```
OTLP Receiver → Shared Processors → Direct Export
```

**Characteristics**:

2. **metricstransform/aggregate**
   - Aggregates system CPU metrics
   - Mean aggregation for groups
   - Reduces time series count

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Process priority classification
- Selective attribute stripping
- Group aggregation for low-priority processes
- Dynamic control based on mode

**Cardinality Reduction**: 15-40% (mode dependent)

### Pipeline 3: Experimental TopK

**Purpose**: Advanced sampling for extreme scenarios

**Processing Flow**:
```
OTLP Receiver → Shared Processors → Sampling Processors → Export
```

**Additional Processors**:
1. **probabilistic_sampler**
   - Sampling percentage: 10%
   - Hash seed: 12345 (consistent sampling)
   
**Characteristics**:
- Statistical sampling approach
- Minimal attribute set
- Extreme cardinality reduction
- Suitable for high-volume environments

**Cardinality Reduction**: 70-90%

## Recording Rules Metrics

Phoenix provides comprehensive metrics through Prometheus recording rules:

### Efficiency Metrics

#### phoenix:signal_preservation_score
```promql
1 - (
  sum(rate(otelcol_processor_dropped_metric_points_total[5m])) by (pipeline) / 
  clamp_min(sum(rate(otelcol_receiver_accepted_metric_points_total[5m])) by (pipeline), 1)
)
```
**Purpose**: Measures data fidelity across pipelines  
**Target**: >0.95  
**Use**: Validates optimization isn't losing critical data

#### phoenix:cardinality_efficiency_ratio
```promql
phoenix_observer_kpi_store_phoenix_pipeline_output_cardinality_estimate{pipeline="optimized"} /
clamp_min(phoenix_observer_kpi_store_phoenix_pipeline_output_cardinality_estimate{pipeline="full_fidelity"}, 1)
```
**Purpose**: Compares optimized vs full pipeline cardinality  
**Target**: 0.6-0.85 (depending on mode)  
**Use**: Tracks reduction effectiveness

#### phoenix:resource_efficiency_score
```promql
(phoenix:signal_preservation_score * 100) / 
clamp_min(phoenix:memory_utilization_percentage + phoenix:cpu_utilization_percentage, 1)
```
**Purpose**: Cost efficiency metric  
**Target**: >1.0  
**Use**: Ensures optimization provides value

### Performance Metrics

#### phoenix:pipeline_latency_p99
```promql
histogram_quantile(0.99, 
  sum(rate(otelcol_processor_batch_timeout_trigger_send_total[5m])) by (pipeline, le)
)
```
**Purpose**: 99th percentile processing latency  
**Target**: <50ms  
**Use**: Monitors processing performance

#### phoenix:pipeline_throughput_rate
```promql
sum(rate(otelcol_receiver_accepted_metric_points_total[5m])) by (pipeline)
```
**Purpose**: Metrics ingestion rate  
**Use**: Capacity planning and scaling decisions

### Control System Metrics

#### phoenix:control_loop_effectiveness
```promql
abs(phoenix_observer_kpi_store_phoenix_pipeline_output_cardinality_estimate{pipeline="optimized"} - 20000) / 20000
```
**Purpose**: Distance from target cardinality  
**Target**: <0.1 (within 10% of target)  
**Use**: PID controller tuning

### Anomaly Detection Metrics

#### phoenix:cardinality_zscore
```promql
(
  phoenix_observer_kpi_store_phoenix_pipeline_output_cardinality_estimate - 
  avg_over_time(phoenix_observer_kpi_store_phoenix_pipeline_output_cardinality_estimate[1h])

## Best Practices

### Monitoring Pipeline Health
1. Watch `phoenix:signal_preservation_score` - should stay >0.95
2. Monitor `phoenix:pipeline_error_rate` - should be <0.01
3. Track `phoenix:control_stability_score` - should be >0.8
4. Review anomaly alerts daily

### Tuning Recommendations
1. Start with Balanced mode
2. Adjust thresholds based on actual cardinality
3. Use benchmark controller to validate changes
4. Monitor for 24h before production changes

### Troubleshooting Pipeline Issues
1. Check shared processor health first
2. Verify routing configuration
3. Ensure export endpoints are reachable
4. Review recording rule evaluation times
