# Agent Roles Documentation

Agent roles documentation has been moved to the root-level `/agents/` directory.

## Available Documentation (in `/agents/` directory)

- [/agents/CONSOLIDATED_AGENTS.md](/agents/CONSOLIDATED_AGENTS.md) - **Primary documentation** with all roles, responsibilities, and workflows
- [/agents/AGENTS.md](/agents/AGENTS.md) - Basic role definitions and responsibilities
- [/agents/AGENT_RAILS.md](/agents/AGENT_RAILS.md) - Guidelines for autonomous agents

All agent YAML definition files are also stored in the root-level `/agents/` directory for better visibility and integration with CI/CD tools.

> **Note**: Please do not use the files in the `/docs/agents/` directory as they are deprecated and will be removed in a future update.
