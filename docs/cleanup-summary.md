# Phoenix Project Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the cleanup actions performed on the Phoenix (SA-OMF) repository structure to improve organization, eliminate duplication, and enhance maintainability.

## Actions Completed

### 1. Eliminated Deprecated Documentation

- **Removed `/docs/agents/` Directory**: This directory was deprecated as its content had been migrated to the top-level `/agents/` directory.
  - Deleted files: `AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md`, `AGENT_DECISIONS.md`, `AGENT_ONBOARDING.md`, and `README.md`
  - All content was already consolidated in the `/agents/` directory files

### 2. Consolidated Benchmark Directories

- **Merged `/test/benchmark/` into `/test/benchmarks/`**: Eliminated duplicate benchmark directories by consolidating all benchmark-related code into a single location.
  - Moved files: 
    - `cache.go`
    - `resource_profiler.go`
    - `component/pid_controller_benchmark_test.go`
    - `e2e/priority_tagger_benchmark_test.go`
  - Removed redundant directory structure

### 3. Documented Docker Compose File Relationships

- **Created `/deploy/compose/README.md`**: Added documentation to explain the relationship between multiple docker-compose files in the repository.
  - Documented purpose and usage of each docker-compose file
  - Provided clear examples for different deployment scenarios
  - Explained environment variable customization options

### 4. Organized Root-Level Documentation

- **Moved Planning Documents to `/docs/project-planning/`**:
  - `implementation-plan.md`
  - `audit-plan.md`
  - `project-setup-review.md`

- **Moved PR-Related Documents to `/docs/pr-management/`**:
  - `pr-fixes-summary.md`
  - `pr-merge-plan.md`

- **Created Documentation Index**: Added `/docs/INDEX.md` to provide a comprehensive index of all documentation in the repository.

### 5. Enhanced Audit Framework Documentation

- **Added `/audit/README.md`**: Created a README file for the audit directory to explain its purpose, structure, and usage.
  - Documented directory organization
  - Listed key documents and their purposes
  - Provided instructions for using audit tools
  - Explained report format and contribution guidelines

## Benefits

These cleanup actions provide several benefits:

1. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated redundant code and documentation
2. **Improved Navigation**: Better organization makes it easier to find relevant files
3. **Enhanced Documentation**: Added context to explain directory structures and relationships
4. **Better Maintainability**: Cleaner structure makes the codebase easier to maintain
5. **Clearer Guidance**: New README files help orient developers to the project structure

## Next Steps

While the current cleanup focused on structural organization, additional improvements could include:

1. Code quality enhancements (already addressed in previous cleanup tasks)
2. Further consolidation of configuration files
3. Implementation of more consistent naming conventions
4. Review of test organization for additional consolidation opportunities
