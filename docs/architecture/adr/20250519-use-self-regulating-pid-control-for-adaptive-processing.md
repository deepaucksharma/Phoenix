# Use Self-Regulating PID Control for Adaptive Processing

Date: 2025-05-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Phoenix system needs to adapt its processing behavior in real-time based on observed metrics. Traditional approaches use static configuration or manual tuning, which doesn't work well in dynamic environments where workloads can change dramatically.

Potential approaches include:
1. Manual tuning and periodic updates
2. ML-based prediction and optimization
3. Rule-based heuristics
4. Feedback control systems

Each approach has trade-offs in terms of complexity, responsiveness, and stability.

## Decision

We will implement a self-regulating system using PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers to adjust key parameters based on observed metrics.

The system will:
- Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) like coverage percentage
- Compare these KPIs to target values
- Use PID control loops to adjust parameters (like top-k values)
- Include safety mechanisms to prevent oscillation or runaway conditions

## Consequences

### Positive

- The system can adapt automatically to changing conditions
- No human intervention needed for typical workload changes
- Well-understood control theory principles apply
- Simple to reason about compared to ML approaches

### Negative

- Requires careful tuning of the PID controllers themselves
- Multiple interacting PID loops can create complex behaviors
- May need to add anti-windup and other stabilizing mechanisms

## Alternatives Considered

### Manual Tuning

Pros:
- Simpler implementation
- Human judgment for quality

Cons:
- Doesn't adapt to changing conditions
- Requires ongoing maintenance

### ML-based Approach

Pros:
- Could potentially handle more complex optimization
- Could learn from patterns over time

Cons:
- Much more complex to implement and test
- Lacks transparency and predictability
- Requires training data

### Rule-based Heuristics

Pros:
- Predictable behavior
- No oscillation

Cons:
- Difficult to tune for all scenarios
- Tends to be either too aggressive or too conservative

## Implementation Notes

1. Create a configurable PID controller implementation
2. Design a clear separation between KPI measurement and parameter adjustment
3. Implement safety limits and guard rails
4. Add comprehensive metrics and observability for the controllers themselves
