# Test Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of new test scenarios for the Phoenix project.

## Tasks Created

We've created task definitions for 17 new test scenarios covering various aspects of the system:

1. **Dual-Pipeline Wiring (3 tasks)**
   - PIPE-05: Control Pipeline Missing Self-Metrics
   - PIPE-06: Simultaneous Data & Control Pipeline Restart
   - PIPE-07: Multiple PID Decider Instances

2. **Policy & Config-Patch Governance (5 tasks)**
   - POL-05: Patch with Invalid Parameter Value Type
   - POL-06: Patch Targeting Non-UpdateableProcessor
   - POL-07: Policy with Conflicting PID Output Targets
   - POL-08: Safe Mode Policy Application
   - POL-09: Policy File Syntax Error

3. **PID Controller Behavior (4 tasks)**
   - PID-05: KPI Metric Flapping/Unstable
   - PID-06: Controller Disabled/Enabled via Policy
   - PID-07: PID Output Parameter Out of Bounds
   - PID-08: Stall Detection & Bayesian Fallback

4. **Component-Level Tests (1 task)**
   - COMP-PRC-03: Cardinality Guardian High Cardinality

5. **Chaos Tests (2 tasks)**
   - CHAOS-POLICY: Corrupt Policy File During Hot-Reload
   - CHAOS-PATCH: Flood of Conflicting Patches

6. **Advanced Processor Tests (1 task)**
   - ADV-PCL-01: Process Context Learner Hierarchy

## Implementations Completed

We've implemented several test scenarios:

1. **POL-05: Patch with Invalid Parameter Value Type Test**
   - Test verifies pic_control correctly validates and rejects patches with wrong types
   - Implemented in `test/e2e/policy/invalid_parameter_type_test.go`
   - Uses mock processor to test type validation
   - Verifies both rejection of invalid type and acceptance of valid type

2. **PID-07: PID Output Parameter Out of Bounds Test**
   - Test verifies PID controller output values are clamped to defined min/max bounds
   - Implemented in `test/e2e/pid/output_parameter_bounds_test.go`
   - Tests both upper and lower bound clamping
   - Verifies metrics for clamping are emitted

3. **CHAOS-POLICY: Corrupt Policy File During Hot-Reload Test**
   - Test verifies pic_control handles corrupt policy files gracefully
   - Implemented in `test/e2e/chaos/corrupt_policy_test.go`
   - Tests corruption during hot-reload process
   - Verifies system continues with last known good policy
   - Verifies recovery when valid policy is restored

4. **PIPE-05: Missing Self-Metrics Test**
   - Test verifies control pipeline handles missing self-metrics gracefully
   - Implemented in `test/e2e/pipelines/missing_self_metrics_test.go`
   - Verifies no panic occurs when KPIs are missing
   - Checks that appropriate metrics are emitted
   - Tests recovery when metrics become available again

## Supporting Components Created

To support the test implementations, we've created several supporting components:

1. **Test Utilities**
   - `testutils.MockUpdateableProcessor`: Mock implementation of the UpdateableProcessor interface
   - `testutils.MockHost`: Mock implementation of the component.Host interface

2. **Metrics Support**
   - `metrics.MetricsCollector`: Utility for collecting and analyzing metrics

3. **Test Helpers**
   - `adaptive_pid.ProcessMetricsForTest`: Helper method for testing PID processing

4. **Documentation**
   - `docs/testing/test-scenarios.md`: Comprehensive documentation of all test scenarios
   - `docs/testing/implementation-summary.md`: This summary document

## Next Steps

The following tasks still need implementation:

1. Complete remaining test implementations according to task definitions
2. Add CI integration for running the tests as part of test matrix
3. Expand test coverage to include more edge cases and failure modes
4. Create a performance testing framework for the tests marked as performance-critical
5. Develop more detailed mocks for complex components like PID controllers
