# New Processor Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of two new processors designed to address the issues identified in the code quality verification of the Phoenix system. These processors are specifically designed to enhance the reliability, observability, and performance of process metrics collection for New Relic.

## 1. Timeseries Estimator Processor

### Purpose
The `timeseries_estimator` processor estimates the number of unique time series being processed, providing critical insights into cardinality and helping to prevent excessive resource consumption.

### Key Features
- **Dual-Mode Operation**: Supports both exact counting and HyperLogLog probabilistic counting
- **Memory Safety**: Implements memory monitoring with automatic fallback to HLL when under pressure
- **Self-Monitoring**: Extensive self-metrics for tracking processor performance and memory status
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Supports runtime configuration changes via ConfigPatch interface
- **Periodic Refresh**: Scheduled resets to prevent unbounded growth

### Improvements Over Issues Found
- ðŸ”§ **Memory Management**: Explicit memory limits with circuit breakers (issue #1)
- ðŸ”§ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for memory allocation (issue #2)
- ðŸ”§ **Performance Benchmarks**: Added benchmarks to test under various loads (issue #3)
- ðŸ”§ **Self-Monitoring**: Rich metrics for observability (issue #9)

### Implementation Notes
- Uses memory monitoring with `runtime.ReadMemStats()` for safety checks
- HLL implementation leverages existing Phoenix `pkg/util/hll` package
- Metrics use the unified metrics collector for consistent reporting
- Tests verify behavior under memory constraints and various cardinality scenarios

## 2. CPU Histogram Converter Processor

### Purpose
The `cpu_histogram_converter` processor transforms cumulative CPU time metrics into CPU utilization histograms, enabling better visualization and analysis of process resource usage.

### Key Features
- **Delta Calculation**: Converts cumulative CPU times to utilization percentages
- **Histogram Generation**: Creates bucketed histograms for distribution analysis
- **Persistent State**: State storage between restarts to handle cumulative metrics
- **Process Management**: LRU eviction to prevent memory growth with many processes
- **Self-Monitoring**: Performance metrics for observability
- **Top-K Integration**: Option to focus only on important processes

### Improvements Over Issues Found
- ðŸ”§ **Process Restart Recovery**: Persistent state storage (issue #2)
- ðŸ”§ **Memory Efficiency**: Process tracking limits with LRU eviction (issue #1)
- ðŸ”§ **Performance Benchmarks**: Tests with various process counts (issue #3)
- ðŸ”§ **Self-Monitoring**: Rich metrics for health monitoring (issue #9)

### Implementation Notes
- Calculates utilization as percentage of CPU core (100% = one full core)
- Uses atomic file operations for reliable state storage
- Supports focused processing with top-k integration
- Handles multiple CPU cores automatically

## Operational Support

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README files for each processor
- Detailed operational playbook for common tasks
- Monitoring guide with dashboard and alerting recommendations

### Tests
- Unit tests for basic functionality
- Tests for memory constraints and failover
- Tests for state persistence and recovery
- Performance benchmarks with various data volumes

## Future Work

The following items remain for future implementation:

1. **Integration Tests with New Relic**: End-to-end tests with a mock New Relic endpoint
2. **Dynamic Attribute Stripping**: Attribute filtering based on cardinality pressure
3. **Enhanced Dashboard Templates**: Ready-to-use visualization templates

## Overall Impact

These processors address the key issues found in the code quality verification:

- Improved reliability with memory limits and circuit breakers
- Enhanced resilience with state persistence
- Better observability with self-monitoring metrics
- Detailed operational documentation
- Comprehensive test coverage

The implementation follows Phoenix project standards and leverages existing utility packages while maintaining efficient resource usage.
