# Benchmark Directory

This directory contains performance benchmarks for the SA-OMF components.

Note: The docs and Makefiles refer to this directory as 'benchmark' (singular), while there's also a 'benchmarks' (plural) directory.
For consistency, we should standardize on one name. Currently, we're keeping both to maintain compatibility.
