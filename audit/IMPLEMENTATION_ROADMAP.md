## Resource Allocation

### Role Assignments
- **Implementer**: Focus on critical fixes and performance optimizations (Phases 1-2)
- **Tester**: Focus on comprehensive test implementation (Phases 1-2)
- **Security Auditor**: Focus on security fixes and ongoing audits (Phases 1, 4)
- **Performance Engineer**: Focus on performance optimizations and audits (Phases 2, 4)
- **Doc Writer**: Focus on documentation improvements (Phase 3)
- **Reviewer**: Ongoing review of implemented solutions (All phases)

### Weekly Allocation
- 60% implementation of prioritized tasks
- 20% testing and verification
- 10% code review
- 10% planning and coordination

## Implementation Process

### For Each Task:
1. **Planning**:
   - Review task definition and acceptance criteria
   - Understand dependencies
   - Design solution approach
   - Create implementation plan

2. **Implementation**:
   - Develop solution according to plan
   - Follow project coding standards
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation

3. **Review**:
   - Submit for peer review
   - Address review feedback
   - Verify acceptance criteria
   - Perform final testing

4. **Integration**:
   - Merge changes to main branch
   - Verify integration with other components
   - Monitor for any unexpected interactions
   - Update relevant documentation

## Dependency Management

The implementation plan accounts for task dependencies:
- PIC Control Extension fixes are prioritized due to their critical nature
- Testing improvements precede functional changes
- Performance optimizations follow correctness fixes
- Documentation updates follow implementation changes

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas
- PIC Control Extension processor discovery implementation
- Policy file security enhancements
- Performance optimizations with large metric sets

### Mitigation Strategies
- Extra review for high-risk changes
- Phased implementation with validation points
- Comprehensive testing with various workloads
- Rollback plans for critical components

## Success Metrics

The implementation roadmap will be considered successful when:
1. All critical and high-priority issues are resolved
2. Test coverage exceeds 80% for core components
3. Documentation is complete and up-to-date
4. Performance meets or exceeds targets under load
5. Security vulnerabilities are addressed

## Conclusion

This implementation roadmap provides a structured approach to addressing the findings from the Phoenix project audit. By following this plan, we will systematically improve component quality, security, performance, and documentation while maintaining system stability.
