# Phoenix Project Audit Agenda

## Overview
This document outlines the structured approach for completing the audit of all Phoenix project components. It defines the audit stages, prioritizes components for review, and establishes a unified methodology to ensure consistent evaluation across the system.

## Audit Objectives
1. Identify security vulnerabilities and implementation issues
2. Ensure code quality and proper implementation of design patterns
3. Verify component interfaces and contract compliance
4. Assess test coverage and quality
5. Evaluate documentation completeness
6. Identify performance bottlenecks and scalability issues

## Audit Phases

### Phase 1: Core Control System (Current priority)
- âœ… PID Controller
- â¬œ Safety Monitor
- â¬œ Config Patch Validator
- â¬œ PIC Control Extension (partially audited)
- â¬œ PIC Connector

**Rationale**: The control system forms the foundation of the adaptive architecture. Issues in these components could affect the entire system's stability and safety.

### Phase 2: Key Processors (Next in line)
- âœ… Adaptive TopK (partially audited)
- â¬œ Adaptive PID
- â¬œ Priority Tagger
- â¬œ Process Context Learner

**Rationale**: These processors implement the core adaptive functionality and directly affect system behavior.

### Phase 3: Supporting Processors
- â¬œ Cardinality Guardian
- â¬œ Reservoir Sampler
- â¬œ Others Rollup
- â¬œ Multi-Temporal Adaptive Engine
- â¬œ Semantic Correlator

**Rationale**: These processors provide supporting functionality that, while important, has less direct impact on overall system stability.

### Phase 4: Utility Libraries
- âœ… HyperLogLog
- â¬œ Bayesian Gaussian Process
- â¬œ Causality Detection
- â¬œ Reservoir
- â¬œ Timeseries
- â¬œ TopK

**Rationale**: The utility algorithms provide foundational computational capabilities but are generally self-contained with well-defined interfaces.

### Phase 5: Cross-Component Integration
- â¬œ Pipeline interaction
- â¬œ Configuration flow
- â¬œ Error propagation
- â¬œ Metrics collection
- â¬œ Resource management

**Rationale**: After auditing individual components, we need to verify their interaction and system-wide behaviors.

## Audit Process for Each Component

### 1. Pre-Audit Preparation (1 day)
- Review component architecture and interfaces
- Understand component's role in the system
- Identify key requirements and constraints
- Review related ADRs and design documentation

### 2. Code Review (1-3 days)
- Assess code quality and style
- Review algorithm implementations
- Identify security concerns
- Evaluate error handling and edge cases
- Check for performance optimizations

### 3. Test Evaluation (1 day)
- Assess test coverage and quality
- Identify missing test scenarios
- Evaluate performance tests
- Check for security testing

### 4. Documentation Review (1 day)
- Evaluate inline documentation
- Check for README and usage examples
- Verify API documentation
- Assess operational documentation

### 5. Audit Report Creation (1 day)
- Document findings with severity levels
- Provide specific recommendations
- Create actionable tasks
- Include code references and examples

*This schedule will be updated as audits are completed and new components are scheduled.*

## Audit Team Assignments

### Security Auditor
- Core control system components
- Security-sensitive components
- Policy management

### Performance Engineer
- Processor components
- Algorithms
- Performance-critical paths

### Documentation Specialist
- Cross-component documentation
- User guides
- Operational documentation

## Reporting and Task Creation

Each completed audit will result in:
1. Detailed audit report in `/audit/components/[type]/[component].md`
2. Task files created in `/tasks/` directory for each finding
3. Updates to the audit summary report
4. Updates to the audit dashboard

## Tracking Progress

Progress will be tracked via:
1. Weekly audit status meetings
2. Updated audit dashboard
3. Task management system
4. Component completion metrics

## Review Cycle

After implementation of audit-related tasks, components will undergo a review cycle to ensure that:
1. All critical and high-priority issues have been addressed
2. The implementation meets acceptance criteria
3. No new issues have been introduced
4. Documentation has been updated

## Conclusion

This audit agenda provides a structured approach to systematically review all components of the Phoenix project. By following this plan, we can ensure comprehensive coverage, consistent evaluation, and effective remediation of issues.
