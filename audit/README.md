# Phoenix (SA-OMF) Audit Framework

This directory contains the audit framework for the Phoenix project, including tools, documentation, and audit results.

## Overview

The audit framework is designed to:
- Ensure consistency across components
- Verify compliance with architectural standards
- Identify potential issues early in the development cycle
- Document important design decisions and their rationale

## Directory Structure

- `/audit/components/` - Component-specific audit results
  - `/audit/components/algorithms/` - Algorithm implementations audit
  - `/audit/components/control/` - Control system audit
  - `/audit/components/extensions/` - Extensions audit
  - `/audit/components/processors/` - Processors audit
- `/audit/configurations/` - Configuration audit
- `/audit/interfaces/` - Interface contract audit
- `/audit/utils/` - Utility functions audit

## Key Documents

- [AUDIT_AGENDA.md](./AUDIT_AGENDA.md) - Audit timeline and milestone planning
- [AUDIT_METRICS.md](./AUDIT_METRICS.md) - Metrics for measuring audit effectiveness
- [IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) - Implementation roadmap based on audit findings
- [REVIEW_PROCESS.md](./REVIEW_PROCESS.md) - The review process for audits
- [audit-workflow.md](./audit-workflow.md) - Workflow for conducting audits
- [component-audit-checklist.md](./component-audit-checklist.md) - Checklist for component audits
- [summary.md](./summary.md) - Summary of audit findings

## Tools

- [audit-tool.py](./audit-tool.py) - Python script for automated audit checks
- [initialize-audit.sh](./initialize-audit.sh) - Script to initialize a new audit
- [dashboard.html](./dashboard.html) - Visual dashboard for audit results

## Usage

To initialize a new component audit:

```bash
./initialize-audit.sh <component-name> <component-type>
```

To run the automated audit tool:

```bash
python audit-tool.py --component <component-name> --type <component-type>
```

To view the audit dashboard, open `dashboard.html` in a web browser.

## Report Format

Audit reports are stored in the component directories and follow a standardized format:

1. Component overview
2. Compliance assessment
3. Issues identified
4. Recommended actions
5. Audit metadata (date, auditor, version)

## Contributing to Audits

When adding new audit reports:

1. Use the templates provided
2. Follow the checklist in component-audit-checklist.md
3. Update the summary.md and summary.yaml files
4. Request a review from at least one other team member
