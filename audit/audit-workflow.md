# Phoenix Component Audit Workflow Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the component-by-component audit plan using the included audit tool.

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize the Audit Structure

First, initialize the audit directory structure and discover all components:

```bash
mkdir -p audit
python audit/audit-tool.py init --project-root $(pwd) --audit-dir audit
```

This will:
- Create the audit directory structure
- Generate audit YAML files for each component
- Initialize the summary tracking file

### 2. Review the Audit Plan

Familiarize yourself with the audit plan:

```bash
less audit-plan.md
```

## Conducting Component Audits

### Workflow for Each Component

Follow this process for each component:

1. **Assign the component audit**
   ```bash
   python audit/audit-tool.py status adaptive_topk "In Progress" --owner "Jane Doe"
   ```

2. **Review code and tests**
   - Examine the component implementation
   - Review unit and integration tests
   - Check documentation quality
   - Assess interface compliance

3. **Run targeted tests and analysis**
   ```bash
   # Run unit tests for the component
   go test -v ./internal/processor/adaptive_topk/...
   
   # Run benchmarks
   go test -v ./test/benchmarks/... -bench=Adaptive
   
   # Check test coverage
   go test -cover ./internal/processor/adaptive_topk/...
   ```

4. **Record issues and recommendations**
   ```bash
   # Add an issue finding
   python audit/audit-tool.py issue adaptive_topk Medium "Memory usage grows with high cardinality" \
      --location "processor.go:125" \
      --remediation "Implement counter pruning mechanism"
   
   # Add a recommendation
   python audit/audit-tool.py recommend adaptive_topk "Add benchmarks for skewed distributions"
   ```

5. **Mark as completed**
   ```bash
   python audit/audit-tool.py status adaptive_topk "Completed"
   ```

6. **Generate report**
   ```bash
   python audit/audit-tool.py report
   ```

## Audit Tracking and Reporting

### Regular Status Updates

Generate reports to track audit progress:

```bash
# Text report to console
python audit/audit-tool.py report

# HTML report
python audit/audit-tool.py report --format html --output audit-report.html
```

### Team Coordination

For team-based audits:

1. **Daily sync on audit progress**
   - Review completed components
   - Discuss high-priority issues
   - Re-assign components as needed

2. **Weekly comprehensive review**
   - Generate full HTML report
   - Review all critical and high issues
   - Prioritize remediation tasks

## Sample Audit Schedule

Below is a recommended schedule for auditing the main component groups:

| Week | Component Group | Components |
|------|----------------|------------|
| 1 | Core Interfaces | UpdateableProcessor, ConfigPatch |
| 1 | Control Components | PID Controller, Safety Monitor |
| 2 | Base Components | Base Processor, PIC Control Extension |
| 2 | Priority Processors | Priority Tagger, Adaptive TopK |
| 3 | Advanced Processors | Adaptive PID, Others Rollup |
| 3 | Specialized Processors | Cardinality Guardian, Process Context Learner |
| 4 | Connectors & Export | PIC Connector |
| 4 | Utility Algorithms | HyperLogLog, Space-Saving, Reservoir Sampling |

## Detailed Component Assessment Checklist

### For Processors

1. **Interface Compliance**
   - [ ] Implements UpdateableProcessor interface correctly
   - [ ] Handles config patches properly
   - [ ] Returns accurate config status

2. **Documentation Quality**
   - [ ] README covers purpose and functionality
   - [ ] Config options documented
   - [ ] Method documentation complete

3. **Test Coverage**
   - [ ] Unit tests for all methods
   - [ ] Edge cases covered
   - [ ] Benchmarks for performance-critical paths

4. **Performance Characteristics**
   - [ ] Memory usage under various workloads
   - [ ] CPU efficiency
   - [ ] Scaling with input size

5. **Error Handling**
   - [ ] Validates inputs
   - [ ] Returns meaningful errors
   - [ ] Handles edge cases gracefully

6. **Thread Safety**
   - [ ] Properly uses locks/mutexes
   - [ ] Avoids race conditions
   - [ ] Safe for concurrent access

### For Control Components

1. **Algorithm Correctness**
   - [ ] PID calculations accurate
   - [ ] Control logic works as expected
   - [ ] Handles edge cases properly

2. **Safety Mechanisms**
   - [ ] Resource threshold enforcement
   - [ ] Rate limiting implementation
   - [ ] Safe mode functionality

3. **Configuration**
   - [ ] Tuning parameters accessible
   - [ ] Defaults reasonably set
   - [ ] Validates configuration values

## Issue Remediation

For each identified issue:

1. Create a task in your issue tracker
2. Link to the audit issue
3. Assign priority based on severity
4. Track progress in both audit tool and issue tracker

## Conclusion

By following this structured workflow, you can systematically audit all components of the Phoenix project, ensuring quality, security, and optimal performance. Regular reporting helps keep the team aligned and focused on high-priority issues.

Remember to keep the audit records updated as components evolve, and periodically re-audit critical components after significant changes.
