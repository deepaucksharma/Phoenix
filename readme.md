A self-optimizing OpenTelemetry Collector designed to intelligently adapt its processing behavior based on real-time performance metrics.

## Project Overview

**Project Codename**: Phoenix  
**Target Implementation Timeline**: 18 months  
**Repository Structure**: Monorepo with modular packages  

The Self-Aware OpenTelemetry Metrics Fabric (SA-OMF) is an advanced metrics collection and processing system built on top of OpenTelemetry. It features:

- **Adaptive processing**: Automatically adjusts processing parameters based on system behavior
- **Dual pipeline architecture**: Data pipeline for metrics processing and control pipeline for self-monitoring
- **PID control loops**: Self-regulation of key parameters to maintain optimal performance
- **Safety mechanisms**: Built-in guard rails to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Offline-capable**: Uses vendored dependencies for builds in network-restricted environments
